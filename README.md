# SAPONIFY Ecommerce Site

## About 
Saponify is an ecommerce site selling handcrafted artisan soaps. Built with a React front and a Commerce.js Headless CMI handling the backend order processing and product line ups, I wanted to try if I can build an efficient ecommerce site with a headless CMI. Stripe API is used to handle online credit card transactions. 

## Landing Page 
The landing page features a beautiful carousel of artisan soaps. Clients are able to click on the arrow keys to see the next image.

## Products Page

Clients can click on the "Add to Cart" icon on the product which automatically adds the item to the cart before purchase.

This ecommerce site has a sleek design and is suitable for this kind of niche shop. This is the project that let me practice Tailwind CSS alongside with React for the first time which help me learn about the basics of web design.
